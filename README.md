# Project Description
Missing Puzzle is a landing page based on the one extracted from the website https://collectui.com/designers/michalroszyk/landing-page, where I've incorporated my personal style into some elements while maintaining the main structure of the original one.
The frontend is entirely built using React and CSS.
This project aims to solidify the concepts studied and applied during the completed master's program.
 

# Platform Walkthrough

### Landing Page
This web application is a single-page design intended for PC screens. The page features a cooperative color palette used consistently across various elements to emphasize important words and links, which change color on hover.

At the top of the page, a navigation bar is provided for user-friendly access to other pages. 

In the middle of the page, the purpose is explained, accompanied by an appealing image to capture the audience's attention. 

At the bottom of the page, a grid of cards showcases various available job opportunities.

In the screenshots below, you can view the original landing page, which served as inspiration for mine.
